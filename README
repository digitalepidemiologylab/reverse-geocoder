This is a simple reverse geocoder. 

This uses GeoDjango and PostGIS and is designed to store data from the U.S.
Census Bureau's TIGER/Line Shapefiles. 

The simple functionality is to provide a lat, long through a URL and get some
information about that point back (county name, zip code tabulation area etc).
